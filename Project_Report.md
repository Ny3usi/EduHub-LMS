## 1. Introduction
In many educational institutions across Kenya, the management of academic processes such as class scheduling, resource sharing, and student tracking remains largely manual. This creates inefficiencies that affect both staff and learners.  
EduHub-LMS was developed as a prototype system to demonstrate how digital learning platforms can improve efficiency, transparency, and access to educational resources within an institution.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional learning management in universities and colleges often involves paperwork, manual attendance tracking, and unstructured resource sharing.  
These methods lead to delays, data loss, and miscommunication between lecturers and students.  
The absence of a centralized system makes it difficult to coordinate courses, track student performance, and store learning materials efficiently.

## 3. Project Objectives
### General Objective
To develop an efficient Learning Management System that centralizes academic operations for lecturers, students, and administrators.

### Specific Objectives
- To design and implement a structured database for managing student and lecturer information.  
- To automate class scheduling and attendance tracking.  
- To facilitate easy uploading and access of learning resources.  
- To generate performance and attendance reports automatically.  
- To enhance communication and collaboration among academic stakeholders.
